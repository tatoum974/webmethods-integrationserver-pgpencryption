# webMethods Integration Server package for PGP
This project provides a sample Integration Server package for PGP encryption and decryption. It is using the Bouncy Castle library (https://www.bouncycastle.org/, version 165 or + ).

## Requirements

The project was developed and tested on the following installation:
1. Integration Server 10.15
2. Software AG Designer 10.15 with Service Development

## Quick start

To install the project on your local development environment follow these steps.
1. Checkout the repository to your development environment
2. Copy the ```PGP``` folder to ```<install_dir>/IntegrationServer/instances/<instance>/packages```.
3. Download the following Bouncy Castle libraries and copy to ```<install_dir>/IntegrationServer/instances/<instance>/packages/PGP/code/jars/static```
    1. https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/bouncycastle/bcprov***/bcprov-***.jar
    2. https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/bouncycastle/bcpg***/bcpg-***.jar
3. Restart Integration Server

## Run tests

There are tests provided in ```pgp.test```

### Decrypt

- **decrypt:testDecryptAndVerifyFile:** Decrypt file and verify its signature
- **decrypt:testDecryptAndVerifyString:** Decrypt signed string and verify its signature
- **decrypt:testDecryptAndVerifyUnsignedString:** Decrypt unsigned string and verify its signature
- **decrypt:testDecryptFile:** Decrypt file (no signature verification)
- **decrypt:testDecryptString:** Decrypt string (no signature verification)

### Encrypt
- **encrypt:testEncryptAndSignFile:** Encrypt and sign file
- **encrypt:testEncryptAndSignString:** Encrypt and sign string
- **encrypt:testEncryptFile:** Encrypt file (no signing)
- **encrypt:testEncryptString:** Encrypt string (no signing)

### Keys
- **keys:testListAlgorithms:** List all supported algorithms
- **keys:testReadPrivateKeys:** Read a private key by user id
- **keys:testReadPublicKeys:** Read a public key by user id


## Key-Configuration

Configuration of RSA keys is done in ```\config\config.xml```. A demo configuration is provided with this package.
```
Note: package assumes keys to be located in \pub\keys. In the configuration provide filenames only (without path).
```

## Provided RSA keys

The package comes with two RSA keys for users ```alice``` and ```bob```. You can find the RSA keys in ```\pub\keys```. The keys have been generated using https://www.igolder.com/pgp/generate-key/
- **alice-pub.asc:** Alice's public key
- **alice-sec.asc:** Alice's private key, secret: ```alice```
- **bob-pub.asc:** Bob's public key
- **bob-sec.asc:** Bob's private key, secret: ```bob```
